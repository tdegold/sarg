Question
========
Construct and solve the differential equation.

The rate of change of temperature of a cup of tea is proportional to the differene between its temperature and room temperature. When the tea is served it has a temperature of `r ti` and room temperature is `r tu`.

Solution
========
The differential equation is Newton's law of cooling which states the following connection
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dt}T(t) &= k\cdot\left(T_U-T(t)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
If we substitute `r tu` for the surrounding temperature we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dt}T(t) &= k\cdot\left(`r tu`-T(t)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Now this formula can be expressed in Maxima as

```
dgl:'diff(T,t,1)=k*(`r tu`-T);
```

Using commands `ode2` and `ic1` the solution can be calculated.

```
alg:ode2(dgl,T,t);
spe:ic1(alg, t=0,T=`r ti`);
```

These result in

`r res$wol$latex`
